# Solar-Power-Management-Using-STM32

This project is a replica project that imitates the https://nevonprojects.com/solar-power-measurement-system-using-arm-cortex/ project.
Completely written from scratch for NUCLEO-F401RE (STM32-F401RE) but since they are HAL CODES, they can be ported easily to other STM32 boards.

Components for this project include:
*NUCLEO-F401RE
*16X2 I2C LCD
*LDR
*LM35 Linear Temperature Sensor
*Bunch of reisistors for voltage dividers
